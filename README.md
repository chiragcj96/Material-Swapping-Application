# Material-Swapping-Application
A web-application to swap food items in real-time with other users.
 

This is the first step toward developing this web application by creating a set of static HTML5 pages for several core parts of the application flow. These pages serve as a look-and-feel design prototype for later functional / dynamic application development. 


### Standards used for Web Page Design

The fundamental standards for web page design applied here are - 

1.	Pages has valid HTML5 standard. 
2.	No site-builder or automatic site generation tools used here. 
3.	All pages render sensibly cross-browser. 
4.	All pages have full and complete separation of CSS into separate files – only the link(s) to load the CSS are present in the HTML document. No style definitions are within the page. 
5.	All pages have full and complete separation of JavaScript into separate files – only  the link(s) to load are present in the HTML document. 
6.	All resources (CSS, JavaScript, Media) are locally stored with the web application  (e.g., local copy of JavaScript libraries). 

### Application Description:

Here four HTML pages have been developed, according to the following specifications.

1.	Here the material swapping domain is for food items. It has its own unique site branding, categories, and items. 
2.	Each of the pages specified are standalone, individual HTML page. They are not something like framed or one single page with main content section visibly switching. 
3.	Each of the pages have a common design to preserve the look-and-feel of the site. Common look-and-feel elements render exactly the same, so there are seamless transitions with no jitter between pages for common elements. 
4.	Within each of the sections of the overall page layout structure, the content might style differently than the representative theme (color scheme, alignment, etc.), but the illustrated types of content are present and represented in a reasonable and understandable way. 
5.	All of the content are represented using HTML directly (no JavaScript DOM generation). 
6.	For this application, the following specific design standard requirements are considered:
  a.	Validation of HTML5 was performed by the following tool: http://html5.validator.nu/  
  b.	Cross-browser checking for Firefox and Chrome
